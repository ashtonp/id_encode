id_encode
=========

Simple encoder for hiding id numbers when displaying in html. Ever had the need to display data from a database table but only unique key for the table is the primary key? This is a simple encoding/decoding scheme to display/pass the id number without having to directly display the id number.

e.g the id number 483585 would now be displayed as cbYV

Feel free to give it a test run. Enjoy!
